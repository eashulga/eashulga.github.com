abstract = "Measurements of the per-event charged-particle yield as a function of the charged-particle transverse momentum and rapidity are performed using p+Pb collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of sNN=5.02TeV. Charged particles are reconstructed over pseudorapidity |η|<2.3 and transverse momentum between 0.1 GeV and 22 GeV in a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1 μb−1. The results are presented in the form of charged-particle nuclear modification factors, where the p+Pb charged-particle multiplicities are compared between central and peripheral p+Pb collisions as well as to charged-particle cross sections measured in pp collisions. The p+Pb collision centrality is characterized by the total transverse energy measured in −4.9<η<−3.1, which is in the direction of the outgoing lead beam. Three different estimations of the number of nucleons participating in the p+Pb collision are carried out using the Glauber model and two Glauber–Gribov colour-fluctuation extensions to the Glauber model. The values of the nuclear modification factors are found to vary significantly as a function of rapidity and transverse momentum. A broad peak is observed for all centralities and rapidities in the nuclear modification factors for charged-particle transverse momentum values around 3 GeV. The magnitude of the peak increases for more central collisions as well as rapidity ranges closer to the direction of the outgoing lead nucleus."

GasPixel detectors consist of an electron drift volume, an amplification gap and an anode plane based on a semiconductor chip. This technology promises large benefits in high-energy charged-particle tracking. It allows reconstruction of a 3D image of a particle track segment in a single detector layer with high accuracy. Several prototypes of GasPixel detectors based on micromegas technology with different gas mixtures and drift gaps were studied in a test beam. A spatial resolution of 8μm and angular accuracy of about 0.2° in a chip plane were obtained. A dedicated Monte Carlo simulation of GasPixel detectors shows good agreement with experimental data."

A detector setup has been built and tested with particles in a wide range of Lorentz factors (from about 103 to about 4×104 crossing different types of radiators. The measured double-differential (in energy and angle) spectra of the TR photons are in a reasonably good agreement with TR simulation predictions."

abstract = "X-ray Transition radiation detectors (TRDs) are used for particle identification in both high energy physics and astroparticle physics. Particle identification is often achieved based on a threshold effect of the X-ray transition radiation (TR). In most of the detectors, TR emission starts at γ factors above ∼500 and reaches saturation at γ∼2−3⋅103. However, many experiments require particle identification up to γ∼105, which is difficult to achieve with current detectors, based only on the measurement of the photon energy together with the particle ionization losses. Additional information on the Lorentz factor can be extracted from the angular distribution of TR photons. TRDs based on pixel detectors give a unique opportunity for precise measurements of spectral and angular distributions of TR at the same time. A 500 μm thick silicon sensor bump bonded to a Timepix3 chip was used in a test beam measurement at the CERN SPS. A beam telescope was employed to separate clusters produced by the primary beam particles from the potential TR clusters. Spectral and angular distributions of TR were studied with high precision for the first time using beams of pions, electrons and muons at different momenta. In this paper, the measurement and analysis techniques are described, and first results are presented."

abstract = "Growing energies of particles at modern or planned particle accelerator experiments as well as cosmic ray experiments require particle identification at gamma-factors (γ) of up to ∼ 105. At present there are no detectors capable of identifying charged particles with reliable efficiency in this range of γ. New developments in high granular pixel detectors allow one to perform simultaneous measurements of the energies and the emission angles of generated transition radiation (TR) X-rays and use the maximum available information to identify particles. First results of studies of TR energy-angular distributions using gallium arsenide (GaAs) sensors bonded to Timepix3 chips are presented. The results are compared with those obtained using a silicon (Si) sensor of the same thickness of 500 μm. The analysis techniques used for these experiments are discussed."
